To create a maze with only one unique path from the initial corner to the diagonally opposite corner, you can use a maze generation algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) to ensure there is only one path.

### Key Changes:

1. **Maze Generation**: A DFS-based algorithm is used to create a perfect maze with a single unique path from the starting position to the ending position.
2. **Adjusted Maze Dimensions**: The maze dimensions have been slightly adjusted to ensure proper display and functionality.
3. **Drawing Function**: The `draw_maze` function now correctly visualizes the maze based on the generated grid.

This implementation ensures that the player must navigate through a unique path from the initial corner to the diagonally opposite corner.
